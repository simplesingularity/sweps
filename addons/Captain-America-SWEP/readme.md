# Captain America SWEP
A custom Captain America SWEP based on two existing addons by GearFighterCZeta (https://steamcommunity.com/id/cristianzeta) and hathoma (https://steamcommunity.com/id/hathoma).
This version is far from complete but features the famous shield throwing animation. Help wanted for sure.

# Todo
Some sort of logical primary attack or shield mode. I want for the shield to return to the player after initial hit, but I'm not sure how to calculate the vector for such a thing.
